Modules:

Table Detection
    Handle horizontal vs vertical
    club tables with gaps together if they have same start and end col (done)

Formula extraction
    remove redundant formulas 

Column extraction for formulas
    make it work across columns 
    cross sheet references 


LLM
    - Pass each table into LLM
        1.Ask it to detect SKU, Location/Warehouse, Quantity information (boolean)
        2. Ask it to check if this is about inventory management (boolean)

        1 if 1:
            1. Pass table and metadata through llm and identify specific data ranges by their column labels and formulas and explanations
        
        
        Get explanation of all tables 


Final output:
    Sheets with 1.1 
    Tables with 1 in them and their information (formulas, description,etc)

    Descriptions for all the other sheets 

    A general text overview of all the tables and formulas and metadata (done) 

Next Steps:
    1. Create an agent to read the full sheet
    2. write its own code to extract the tables and formulas (only subsection of tables is fine)
    3. 

Prompt:

you are a sales engineer for an inventory planning company with a great skill at paying attention to detail. Given this data can you tell me if this is related to 
inventory on hand by SKU, SKUs, sales history, sales forecast, warehouse/location, quantity

First answer if the data i sent is related or no 
If yes, 
Extract the right column names associated to these in a dictionary format 
Also try to identify data ranges by column labels and formula if it is a known formula 


New:
Fully agentic approach

Module 1:
Scrape tables from excel by generating custom code

Module 2:
Verify if table is related to inventory

Module 3:
Formula Extraction and validation

Issues to be handled:
Times when the num tokens goes > 128k
Pivot Tables





Testing Notebook.ipynb
    Testing a more heurestic approach
        Identify tables by blank rows and then extract them
        Do the same for formulas and column names

NewApproach.ipynb 
    Testing a more heurestic approach pt.2
        Fetch coordinates of the tables and use that to extract the tables
        Perform the same for formulas and column names, 
        perform table merging if tables are one below another with same dimensions,
        Perform formula reconciliation if mentions in the same sheet
